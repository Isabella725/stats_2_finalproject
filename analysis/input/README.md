# Input Directory


I am using data from American National Election Studies. I am using the 2016 Time Series Study located here: https://electionstudies.org/project/2016-time-series-study/. This study used two waves of interviews, pre and post election in 2016. (*I still need to identify which wave I am using, or if I am using both in my analysis). Both face-to-face and internet interviews were used to collect the data.
